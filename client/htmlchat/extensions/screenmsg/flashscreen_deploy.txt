We support two ways to apply the plugin in you chat with php and tomcat.
2.1 PHP:
2.1.1 First of all, you web path need support curl module.
2.1.2 To deploy on php server, you need copy the two file config.php, flashscreen.php under /plugin/flashscreen/server fold to you web path which could be visited
at the url that configured at config.js

/*** sample code ***/

/*** sample code ***/

2.1.3 You maybe need to modify the config.php that you just copy with. Moify the two variable $updateCreditsAPI $customMessageAPI to you need.
