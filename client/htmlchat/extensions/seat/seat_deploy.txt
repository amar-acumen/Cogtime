1.2 You maybe need to modify the config.php that you just copy with. Moify the two variable $updateCreditsAPI $customMessageAPI to you need. 
   And how to modify the config.php, you can see the explain on config.php.
1.3 Under /plugin/seat/js fold there is a config.js, you need modify the var getSeatURL and updateSeatURL to you need, just like the example.
    Some important infomation is on config.js file and you need read it anyway.
